# DANTextClassifier
Exercise in implementing a Deep Averaging Network (DAN) Text Classifier model. This exercise is associated with UW-Madison's CS 769: Advanced NLP course. 

This text classifer is used for **sentiment classification** (e.g. it determines whether a sentence is **Positive** or **Negative**). 

# Resulting Accuracy
With this model I was able to achieve the following accuracies with various datasets:
- Training accuracy: 99.50%
  -   1587/1595
- Dev accuracy: 87.76%
  -   215/245
- Test accuracy: 93.06%
  -   228/245
